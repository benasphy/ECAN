# Project ECAN

## Overview
This project includes significant improvements in modularity, error handling, and maintainability. The following files have been updated or newly introduced to enhance the system's functionality.

---

## Key Improvements

### **Main Enhancements in `main.py`**
âœ… **Removed `sys.path.append`** â†’ Now relies on proper module imports.
âœ… **Refactored Agent Registration into a Separate Function** â†’ More modular and maintainable.
âœ… **Fixed Infinite Loop Issue** â†’ Runs `scheduler.run_continuously()` only once.
âœ… **Better Exception Handling** â†’ Uses `finally` to ensure cleanup.
âœ… **More Readable `agent_paths` Dictionary** â†’ Improves maintainability.

---

### **Enhancements in `agent_base.py`**
#### **Threading Concerns**
- The `StreamMethod` class spawns a new thread for each method call but lacks proper thread management, which could lead to resource leaks.
- There is no mechanism to stop or join the threads properly.

#### **Agent Object Initialization Issues**
- The `_init_metta` method now properly handles cases where `_metta` is already initialized.
- `_load_code` validates if `_metta` is correctly set before execution.

#### **Error Handling**
- The `run` method now catches unexpected cases where `_code` might not be properly set or loaded.

#### **Code Readability and Maintainability**
- Reduced nested conditionals to improve readability.
- Separated class responsibilities more clearly (agent management, execution, and threading).

---

### **Improvements in `ParallelScheduler.py`**
âœ… **Better Error Handling** â€“ Wraps agent creation and execution in `try-except` blocks.
âœ… **Thread Management** â€“ Uses a fixed number of worker threads for efficiency.
âœ… **Execution Monitoring** â€“ Logs agent execution results and errors.
âœ… **Prevents Excessive CPU Usage** â€“ Adds a short `time.sleep(1)` delay.

## **New Additions**

### **`logger.py`**
ðŸ“Œ **Purpose:** Create a logging utility to record system events and errors.
- Logs system activities for better debugging.
- Centralized logging management for easier maintenance.

### **`visualization.py`**
ðŸ“Œ **Purpose:** Develop functions to plot attention data, facilitating the analysis of attention shifts and patterns.
- Helps in visualizing agent behaviors over time.
- Supports multiple graphing methods for better insights.

### **`config.py`**
ðŸ“Œ **Purpose:** Introduce a centralized configuration system to manage application settings.
- Allows easy modifications to system-wide settings.
- Reduces hardcoded values in the main code.
